Jupyter notebooks used to analyse FOCI-OpenIFS simulations
==========================================================

Note 1: The FOCI-OpenIFS has undergone some development over the years, so not all notebooks are compatible with all model versions. 

Note 2: Some observational data etc are in the `data` directory. This will not be pushed to the git repo to avoid any possible licensing issues. I have tried to include references to observational datasets as much as possible in the notebooks, so that anyone else may reproduce the contents of `data`.
